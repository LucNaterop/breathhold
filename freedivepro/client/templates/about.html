				<p>Hi!</p>
				<p>
					I am Luca Naterop, 24 years old, a student who created this app as a hobby project. I originally started because there were no satisfying apps out there and I wanted bring my own static times to the next level. Since I am not a professional developer, you might encounter some bugs in this app. If you are interested in improving this app, please reach out to me and let me know what issues you have encountered. Also, if you have suggestions, comments, or feature requests, write to me. I will have an open ear for you. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that this app is still under active development. Some features will therefore likely change in upcoming versions.

				Notes on CO2 Tolerance and O2 Deprivation
			</div>
			<div class="item item-text-wrap">
				<h2>CO<sub>2</sub> Tolerance</h2>
				<p>
					Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) tolerance breath/hold intervals will help your body to become tolerant to high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood. It is important to remember that the urge to breathe is caused by high levels of CO<sub>2</sub>, and not low levels of O<sub>2</sub>. If you build up CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance, the urge will come in later. 
				</p><br>
				<h2>O<sub>2</sub> Deprivation</h2>
				<p>
					Oxygen (O2) deprivation breath/hold intervals will help your body deal with low levels of O<sub>2</sub>. 
					When holding your breath, oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels in your blood start to lower. It is therefore immensely important that you train your body to use very little oxygen when holding your breath. In these sessions, you make your body familiar to low levels of O<sub>2</sub>, to which he will respond by actually using less oxygen. 
				</p><br>
				<h2>General remarks</h2>
				<p>
					O<sub>2</sub> deprivation and CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance tables are being automatically generated. In addition, this app gives you the possibility to create your own completely customized tables.
